# review_notes: This detection rule identifies the execution of BlackCat ransomware (BlackCat.exe) on Windows 64-bit systems, signaling a critical security threat. The presence of this file strongly suggests active ransomware activity, potentially leading to data encryption or exfiltration. While false positives from legitimate files with similar names are rare, any detection should be treated as a high priority. Immediate investigation, containment, and response are crucial to mitigate potential system compromise and data loss.
