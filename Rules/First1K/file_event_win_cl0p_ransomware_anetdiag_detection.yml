#  - The Sigma rule effectively captures the critical indicator of compromise for ANetDiag.dll, as described in the CTI report, focusing on its distinct path and filename associated with CL0P ransomwareâ€™s obfuscation and sandbox evasion techniques. Deploying this rule in systems monitoring file events on Windows could enhance detection of CL0P-related activities and facilitate quicker response to the ransomware's obfuscated malware, particularly when found under 7ZipSfx.000.
