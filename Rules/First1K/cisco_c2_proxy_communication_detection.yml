#  - The sigma rule for detecting Cisco devices communicating with known C2 proxy servers has been validated against the CTI report. The IPs (45.32.88.250, 149.28.119.73) and ports (443, 8080, 8443) in the rule match the data from the CTI report. The ruleâ€™s detection logic accurately reflects the outbound connections described in the report.
