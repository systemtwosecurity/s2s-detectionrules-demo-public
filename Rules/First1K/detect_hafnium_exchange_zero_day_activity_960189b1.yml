#  - This sigma rule is well-aligned with the behavior described in the CTI report. It captures the critical aspect of HAFNIUMâ€™s exploitation, focusing on POST requests to /owa/auth/Current/themes/resources/. The detection logic in the Sigma rule mirrors the detection query recommended in the CTI, making it an effective method for identifying these malicious activities.
