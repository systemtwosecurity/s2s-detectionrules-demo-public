#  - This Sigma rule detects the creation of a specific file (flower01.hwp) within the flower01 directory, which is associated with Kimsuky APT's PowerShell-based data collection activities. By focusing on file events, it aims to identify potential persistence mechanisms used by the threat actor. However, the rule may generate false positives if legitimate software operates with similar file and directory names.
