#  - This Sigma rule is designed to detect the creation of a named file mapping object with "12345" in the filename, a suspicious naming convention potentially indicative of malware activity, such as Latrodectus, which may use such mappings to store addresses of functions like base64 for encoding payloads. Although some legitimate software may use non-descriptive or numeric names in file mappings, this rule is focused on identifying abnormal patterns that deviate from typical system or application behavior.
