#  - This Sigma rule detects the presence of a known C2 plugin by matching the MD5 hash `75bfb7d5199bf0c4e62525099b33e14f` in Windows `file_event` logs. The hash is associated with a specific command-and-control (C2) plugin linked to APT41â€™s MoonWalk backdoor. False positives are unlikely, but any detection should be thoroughly investigated due to the potential for hash collisions with benign files.
