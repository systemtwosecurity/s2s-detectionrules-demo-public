#  - This Sigma rule detects the installation of the Linux.Gomir malware by monitoring for the creation of two key files: the executable copied to /var/log/syslogd and the service file created at /etc/systemd/system/syslogd.service. Both file creation events must occur for the rule to trigger, reducing false positives while focusing on the malwareâ€™s persistence mechanism.
