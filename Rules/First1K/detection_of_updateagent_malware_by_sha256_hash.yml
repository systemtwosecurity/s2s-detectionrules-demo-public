#  - This detection rule is designed to identify the presence of the UpdateAgent malware by monitoring for a specific SHA256 hash, which is linked to North Korean threat groups. By focusing on Windows executable files, the rule aims to flag any occurrences of this malware, thus enhancing security measures against known threats. While the rule is critical in its severity, it acknowledges the potential for false positives, emphasizing that although hashes are unique identifiers, there may be rare cases where legitimate files inadvertently match the specified hash.
