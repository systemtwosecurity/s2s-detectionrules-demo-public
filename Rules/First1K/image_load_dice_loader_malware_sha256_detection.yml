#  - This Sigma rule aims to detect the presence of the DiceLoader malware by monitoring for a specific SHA-256 hash associated with its DLL, which is linked to the FIN7 intrusion set. It focuses on Windows image load events to identify when this malicious DLL is loaded into memory. The rule considers the possibility of false positives from legitimate software that may share the same hash, although this is deemed unlikely.
