#  - This Sigma rule detects initial check-in POST requests made by the Latrodectus malware to a command-and-control (C2) server, identified by a hardcoded User-Agent string in HTTP traffic logs. It specifically looks for HTTP POST requests to URIs containing "/test/" and includes a filter to match the distinctive User-Agent string, Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Tob 1.1), used by the malware. This helps identify malicious traffic patterns associated with Latrodectus infections, although rare legitimate applications could potentially trigger false positives due to similar User-Agent strings.
