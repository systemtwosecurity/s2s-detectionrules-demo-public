#  - This Sigma rule detects file downloads to the %AppData% directory, which is a common location used by Latrodectus malware to store and execute its payloads. By focusing on this directory path, the rule aims to flag suspicious file activities that could indicate malware persistence. While this technique is also used by legitimate applications for storing user-specific files, the rule prioritizes the detection of potentially malicious behavior, such as unexpected executable downloads.
