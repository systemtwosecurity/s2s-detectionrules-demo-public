#  - This Sigma rule detects the presence of a specific Program Database (PDB) path, \LinkShares.pdb, in binaries, which can indicate potential KNOTROCK malware activity. It is important to consider that legitimate software development tools may also generate similar PDB paths, which could lead to false positives.
