#  - The Sigma rule provided effectively detects the SQL query pattern executed by the LEMURLOOT web shell on MOVEit Transfer systems, as corroborated by the CTI report. The rule is tailored to recognize the extraction of MOVEit system metadata, specifically targeting SQL query fragments like folder and file identifiers, uploader information, folder paths, and file sizes. This pattern aligns precisely with LEMURLOOTâ€™s actions described in the CTI report, which include accessing Microsoft Azure system settings, file paths, and associated metadata within MOVEit Transfer environments.
