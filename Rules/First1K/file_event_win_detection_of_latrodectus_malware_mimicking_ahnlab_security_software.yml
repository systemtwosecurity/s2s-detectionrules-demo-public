#  - This Sigma rule detects the presence of the "MeDExt.dll" file, or its known malicious hashes, which is part of Latrodectus malware that impersonates the legitimate MeD Engine Extension from AhnLab Smart Defense. The rule monitors Windows file events for any occurrences of this file, either by filename or hash. False positives may arise if legitimate software updates from AhnLab include a file named "MeDExt.dll." Given the potential for significant impact, the rule is assigned a high severity level.
