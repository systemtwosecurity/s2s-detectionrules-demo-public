#  - This Sigma rule detects SSL certificates that match specific indicators associated with Latrodectus malware. It monitors SSL certificate data in Zeek logs for a JA4X hash (96a6439c8f5c_96a6439c8f5c_795797892f9c) and a Subject Common Name of "localhost," both known to be used in Latrodectus C2 communication. This rule helps identify suspicious or malicious SSL certificates potentially used for command-and-control channels.
