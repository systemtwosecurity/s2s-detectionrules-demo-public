#  - The sigma rule for detecting MASEPIE malware C2 activity aligns with the CTI report. The detection rule specifies monitoring for network connections on non-standard high TCP ports (e.g., 54763, 55555) used by MASEPIE for command and control communication, which is consistent with the identified malicious behavior described in the report. The references to specific ports and the malware's functionality further support this alignment.
