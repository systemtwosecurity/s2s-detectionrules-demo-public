#  -This sigma rule aligns closely with tactics observed in multiple reports related to HAFNIUMâ€™s exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Servers. The rule detects ASP-based web shells, including ASPXSPY and China Chopper, which were crucial for remote access and persistence. The mapped CTI reports confirm that web shells were central to the attack, with the attackers leveraging tools like PowerCat and Nishang for lateral movement and data exfiltration. Additionally, the reports emphasize the importance of monitoring IIS and Exchange logs for indicators of these malicious activities, confirming the utility of the Sigma rule in proactive threat detection.
