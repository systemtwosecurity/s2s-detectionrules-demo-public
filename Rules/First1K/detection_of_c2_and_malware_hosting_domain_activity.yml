#  - This Sigma rule identifies DNS queries directed to specific malicious domains such as nishabii.xyz and gcp.pagaelrescate.com, which are linked to C2 servers or malware hosting. The detection is based on matching the queried domain names within Zeek DNS logs. This helps in identifying potential network connections to threat actors' infrastructure, providing early indicators of compromise or malware communications.
