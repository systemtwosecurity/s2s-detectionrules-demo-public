#  - This Sigma rule aims to detect Medusa ransomware activity by identifying file extension modifications to .medusa or .mylock. The rule is highly relevant and accurate, as it directly corresponds to the behavior described in the CTI report. Its efficacy is strong for detecting the final stage of the Medusa ransomware encryption process. The rule's logic aligns well with the threat behavior described in the CTI content. However, it may generate false positives if legitimate software uses these extensions. The rule's simplicity makes it less prone to false negatives.
