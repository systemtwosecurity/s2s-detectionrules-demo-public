#  - This detection rule focuses on identifying the presence of files linked to the RustBucket malware associated with North Korean threat actors by examining their SHA256 hashes. By monitoring file events on Windows systems, this rule provides a targeted approach to detect potentially malicious activity. The use of hash values allows for precise identification of the malware, although the possibility of false positives exists due to hash collisions or legitimate software sharing the same hashes. The high severity level underlines the critical nature of this detection, emphasizing the need for security teams to investigate any alerts generated by this rule thoroughly.
