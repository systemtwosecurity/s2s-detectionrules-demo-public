#  - The CTI report lists this file as part of the "Tickler" malware components used by the "Peach Sandstorm" threat actor in their long-running intelligence-gathering operations. The use of a double extension (.pdf.exe) is a common tactic employed by attackers to deceive users into thinking they're opening a harmless PDF document when they're actually executing malware. This rule does not rely solely on the filename for detection. It combines the file extension pattern (.pdf.exe) with the SHA-256 hash, which significantly strengthens its reliability. This approach avoids the pitfalls of filename-only detection while still leveraging the deceptive filename as part of the detection strategy.
