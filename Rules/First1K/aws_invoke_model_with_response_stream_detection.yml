#  - The Sigma rule "Detection of InvokeModelWithResponseStream API Call" monitors for potential misuse of AWS Bedrock services by detecting invocations of the InvokeModelWithResponseStream API, which could indicate reconnaissance or exploitation of exposed credentials. While the rule is accurate in identifying suspicious activity, the assigned tag attack.credential-access is not entirely appropriate, as the activity described in the CTI report involves abusing existing exposed credentials, not acquiring or escalating them. A more suitable tag would be attack.discovery, reflecting the attackersâ€™ intent to probe resources and gather information. This adjustment ensures the rule aligns with the observed behaviors and provides better contextual clarity for detection frameworks.
