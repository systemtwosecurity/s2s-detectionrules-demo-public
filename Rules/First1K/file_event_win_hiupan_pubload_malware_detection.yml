#  - This Sigma rule is designed to detect specific filenames linked to HIUPAN and PUBLOAD malware, which are key indicators of compromise in Earth Preta campaigns. It monitors for the presence of malicious files to identify potential threats early. False positives may occur from legitimate software using similar filenames, so further analysis may be needed.
