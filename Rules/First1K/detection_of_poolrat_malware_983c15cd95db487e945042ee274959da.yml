#  - This Sigma rule aims to detect POOLRAT malware based on SHA256 hashes identified in antivirus logs. The rule's relevance is high, as it directly corresponds to the POOLRAT section in the CTI report. Its accuracy is good, focusing on specific file hashes associated with the malware. The detection key uses the Signature|contains field, which is appropriate for antivirus logs. The condition is a simple selection, which is logical for this type of detection. However, the rule could be improved by including additional IOCs from the CTI report, such as associated URLs and domains.
