#  - The Sigma rule precisely captures the indicator of compromise highlighted in the CTI report, focusing on a specific executable that exhibits sandbox evasion and string obfuscation tactics used by CL0P ransomware. Implementing this Sigma rule enhances the detection of malicious executables associated with CL0P and is critical for identifying attempts to bypass security mechanisms. 

title: Detection of CL0P Ransomware - Sandbox Detection and String Obfuscation
