#  - This Sigma rule monitors for the creation of a file named w.x in the \user\Documents directory, which is associated with the Kimsuky KGH spyware's activity of storing stolen browser data. By detecting this specific file, the rule aims to identify potential data exfiltration attempts by the spyware. It also considers possible false positives from legitimate applications that might use the same filename pattern, enhancing the precision of detection efforts.
