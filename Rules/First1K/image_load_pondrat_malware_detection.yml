#  - This Sigma rule aims to detect PondRAT malware by identifying specific SHA256 hashes during image load events on Windows systems. The rule's relevance and accuracy are high, as it directly correlates with the CTI report's identified PondRAT hashes. Its efficacy is strong for known samples but limited to the specific hashes listed.The rule accurately incorporates all seven SHA256 hashes for PondRAT mentioned in the CTI report, ensuring comprehensive coverage of known samples
