#  - This rule focuses on detecting when the cron service executes the /.img file, a known indicator of KAIJI malware activity. By monitoring for this specific file execution, security teams can catch early signs of persistence methods used by the malware. However, caution is needed as legitimate cron jobs with similar filenames may cause false positives.
