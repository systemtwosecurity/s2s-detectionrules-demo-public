#  - This rule detects the presence of a specific Version.dll file tied to the Diamond Sleet campaign by monitoring for a unique SHA-256 hash value. Hash-based detection minimizes false positives as it directly identifies the malicious file. Any alerts should be investigated, given that a hash match typically indicates the file is associated with this campaign.
