#  - This Sigma rule detects potential EDRKillShifter ransomware activity by monitoring for the creation and subsequent deletion of a "Config.ini" file in the same location where the binary is executed. This behavior matches the ransomwareâ€™s tactic of creating and loading an encrypted configuration file, then deleting it as part of its evasion techniques. The rule alerts on any similar pattern, which may indicate malicious actions associated with this ransomware loader.
