# review_notes: The rule identifies HTTP requests to /test/1.txt on a known C2 server (66.42.98.220), indicating potential reconnaissance targeting Cisco RV320 routers. It uses Cisco syslog as the log source, with accurate schema and detection logic. The reference validates the detection context, aligning it with Mitre ATT&CK TA0007 (Discovery).
