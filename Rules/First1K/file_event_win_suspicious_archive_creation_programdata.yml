#  - "The sigma rule aligns closely with the CTI report's findings by focusing on detecting the creation of compressed archives in C:\ProgramData\ as part of HAFNIUMâ€™s exfiltration strategy. The CTI report further enhances the detection strategy by recommending specific Sysmon and Event log queries to capture suspicious processes and archive-related activities. This comprehensive approach strengthens detection and minimizes the chance of missing malicious behavior.
