#  - This Sigma rule detects potential persistence methods of the Latrodectus malware by monitoring for the creation or modification of DLL files with specific naming patterns in the APPDATA directory. It targets files with names starting as %APPDATA%\falsify_steward\confrontation_ or %APPDATA%\Custom_update\Update_ and ending in .dll, which are linked to Latrodectus's persistence behavior. This rule helps identify suspicious DLL files that may be used by the malware to maintain access on an infected system, though some legitimate software could potentially trigger similar patterns.
