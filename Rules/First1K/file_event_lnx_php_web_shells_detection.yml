#  - This Sigma rule detects the creation or modification of PHP web shell files, commonly used by attackers to maintain access to compromised servers, by monitoring specific filenames such as exp_door v1.0.2.php, WSO 4.0.5.php, and b374k.php. It targets Linux file event logs to identify malicious files. To reduce false positives, correlation with other suspicious activities or tools that may use similar filenames is recommended.
