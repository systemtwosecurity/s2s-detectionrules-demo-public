# review_notes:
#  - The sigma rule and CTI report are aligned, detecting file encryption activity linked to Cicada3301 ransomware. The CTI report notes that Cicada3301 changes file names from RECOVER-<ransomware extension>-FILES.txt to RECOVER-<ransomware extension>-DATA.txt. This naming convention is key for identifying ransomware activity, as the group uses similar tactics to other ransomware families, including Rust-based malware.
