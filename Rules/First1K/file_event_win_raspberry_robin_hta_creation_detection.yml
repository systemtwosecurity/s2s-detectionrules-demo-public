#  - The sigma rule is designed to detect the creation of HTA files associated with the Raspberry Robin infection chain. It specifically targets HTA files with names such as access.hta, bootstrap.hta, bundle.hta, and min.hta, which are commonly used by the malware. The rule is intended to capture file creation events that match this pattern, and its effectiveness in detecting malicious activity will be assessed during testing.
