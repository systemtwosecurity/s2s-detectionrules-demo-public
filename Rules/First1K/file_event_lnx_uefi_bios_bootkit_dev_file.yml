#  - This Sigma rule detects the presence of a file named "/bin/XG210-rkloadtest.bin," which is associated with an early development version of a UEFI BIOS bootkit. It focuses on monitoring file events for this specific file to identify potential persistence mechanisms used by attackers. The detection level is high, with the potential for false positives in legitimate software development activities where files with similar names may be used for testing purposes.
