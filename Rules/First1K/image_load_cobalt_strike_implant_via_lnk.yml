#  - The sigma rule effectively matches the CTI report for detecting the execution of the malicious LNK file (Report.lnk) that launches the Cobalt Strike implant (Documents.dll). Both the DLL hashes and the execution path match the threat activity outlined in the report, confirming the ruleâ€™s accuracy in detecting this behavior.
