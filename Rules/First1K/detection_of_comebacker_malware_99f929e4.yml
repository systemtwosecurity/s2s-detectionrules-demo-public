#  - This Sigma rule aims to detect the presence of Comebacker malware by matching a specific SHA256 hash of a file. The rule is directly relevant to the CTI report, which mentions Comebacker and provides the exact hash used in the detection. The rule's accuracy is high, as it relies on a precise file hash, but its efficacy may be limited due to its narrow focus on a single hash
