#  - This Sigma rule detects network connections originating from specific files related to Latrodectus malware, which masquerades as legitimate security software. It checks for executable files (e.g., confrontation_d46a184c.exe, GoogleAuthSetup.ex, MeDExt.dll) attempting to communicate with known malicious domains associated with the malware campaign. The rule triggers when both conditions are metâ€”presence of the malicious files and connections to the listed domains. False positives could arise from legitimate software using similar file names or domain names with coincidental substrings.
