#  - The sigma rule detecting high-frequency process terminations aligns closely with the CTI report on Clop ransomware, focusing on process disruption activities consistent with Clopâ€™s operational patterns. This rule complements other Clop detection mechanisms in the report, covering multiple ransomware behaviors and ensuring a well-rounded detection strategy across process and file activity without overlap.

title: Clop High Frequency Process Termination
id: 5fbd48b5-e0fb-4c13-abd0-25977fa5e4cc
status: experimental
description: Detects a high frequency of process termination events, which could indicate an attempt by malware to disrupt security processes. A threshold of 15 terminations within a 3-second bin is used for detection.
