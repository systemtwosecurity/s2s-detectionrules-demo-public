#  - This Sigma rule identifies the creation of `install.bat` and `storesyncsvc.dll` files in the Windows Temp directory, which are indicators of potential exploitation of CVE-2020-10189, associated with APT41. These files are often used during post-exploitation for privilege escalation. False positives may arise if similar filenames are used by legitimate applications during installations or updates.
