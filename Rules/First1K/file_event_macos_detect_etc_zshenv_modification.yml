#  - This Sigma rule monitors the creation or modification of the /etc/zshenv file, a configuration file used by Zsh on macOS. Such activity can indicate the installation of a persistence mechanism, as /etc/zshenv is executed for every Zsh shell session. The rule targets potential abuse by malware, including the BlueNoroff Hidden Risk campaign, which may modify this file to achieve persistence on macOS systems.
