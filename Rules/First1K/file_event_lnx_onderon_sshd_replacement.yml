#  - This Sigma rule detects the replacement of SSH and SSHD binaries with Onderon malware on Linux systems, which is a sign of an attacker gaining persistence on the system. It monitors file events for these specific binaries. The detection level is high, but false positives could occur from legitimate SSH/SSHD updates by system administrators or official package management tools.
