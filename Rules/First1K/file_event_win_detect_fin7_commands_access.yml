#  - This Sigma rule detects access to a specific file, commands.txt, located in the \sysvols\ directory, which is associated with FIN7's Pillowmint malware for command-and-control purposes. Monitoring access to this file is critical as it may indicate unauthorized access or malware activity. However, legitimate administrative activities might also access similarly named files, leading to potential false positives.
