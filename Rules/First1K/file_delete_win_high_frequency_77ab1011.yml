#  - The sigma rule detecting a high frequency of file deletion aligns closely with the CTI report on Clop ransomware, focusing on bulk deletions of targeted file types consistent with Clopâ€™s operational behaviors. This rule complements other Clop detection mechanisms in the report, creating a comprehensive detection framework across file and process activities, with appropriate false-positive management to ensure effective alerting.
