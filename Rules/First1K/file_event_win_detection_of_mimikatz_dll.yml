#  - This Sigma rule detects the presence of specific DLL files associated with the Mimikatz credential dumping tool, commonly used by attackers for credential access. The rule triggers when files like powerkatz_short32.dll, powerkatz_full64.dll, and others are accessed on a Windows system, indicating potential malicious activity. False positives could arise from legitimate uses such as system administrators or security researchers handling Mimikatz in authorized environments.
