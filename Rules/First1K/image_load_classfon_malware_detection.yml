#  - This Sigma rule detects CLASSFON malware by looking for specific references to DrvDll.dll and PlusDll.dll, along with a known hash (9e1a54d3dc889a7f0e56753c0486fd0f). However, it may result in a false negative if the malware uses different DLL filenames or if legitimate software uses these DLL names. Additionally, if the malwareâ€™s file hash changes or is obfuscated, the detection might miss the activity.
