#  - This rule detects the deletion of the file n.x from the AppData\Local\Temp directory, a behavior associated with the KGH backdoor's cleanup process after executing commands. This pattern may indicate malicious activity, but care is needed as legitimate software could also delete temporary files with similar names, leading to potential false positives. The rule focuses on defense evasion techniques used by malware.
