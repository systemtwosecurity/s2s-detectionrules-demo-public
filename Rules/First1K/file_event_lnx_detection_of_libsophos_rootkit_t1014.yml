#  - This Sigma rule detects the presence of the libsophos.so file, which is associated with the Personal Panda targeted attack. The detection is focused on file events that identify the creation of this specific rootkit file. The rule has a high detection level, and while false positives are unlikely due to the uniqueness of the filename, there could be occasional conflicts with legitimate software using similar names.
