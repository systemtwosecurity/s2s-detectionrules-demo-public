#  - This rule detects the creation and startup of suspicious services such as crond.service and /etc/init.d/linux_kill, which are indicative of KAIJI malware's persistence mechanism. Monitoring for these service names helps identify unauthorized or malicious service setups, though care should be taken to account for potential legitimate software using similar names.
