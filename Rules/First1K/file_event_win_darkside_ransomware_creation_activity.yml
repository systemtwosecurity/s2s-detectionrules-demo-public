#  - The sigma rule is accurately mapped to the findings in the CTI report. The CTI report confirms that the files LOG.8527053e.TXT and README.8527053e.TXT are created as part of the DarkSide ransomware payload, validating the ruleâ€™s detection criteria. Monitoring for the creation of these files is an effective method for detecting potential ransomware attacks.
