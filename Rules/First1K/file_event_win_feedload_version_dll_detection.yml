#  - This Sigma rule detects the creation or modification of a file named Version.dll in any directory on a Windows system. This file is associated with the FeedLoad binary, part of the Diamond Sleet campaign, which may be used for persistence. As legitimate software may also use Version.dll as a file name, detections should be investigated carefully for false positives.
