#  - This Sigma rule utilizes Zeek DNS logs to identify queries to domains associated with BlueNoroff's Hidden Risk campaign, which is known for leveraging command-and-control (C2) infrastructure targeting Mac users. The domains listed, such as docsolanalab.org and online.zoom-client.com, are key indicators of compromise (IOCs) linked to this threat actor. By focusing on DNS query patterns, this rule provides early detection of potential C2 communications.
